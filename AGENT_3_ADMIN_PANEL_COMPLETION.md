## Data Flow

```
User Interaction → Component State → Admin Service → Firestore
                                                    ↓
                                    Data Processing & Aggregation
                                                    ↓
                                    Component State Update → UI Render
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Pagination**: User and location lists support pagination to handle large datasets
2. **Memoization**: useCallback for expensive operations
3. **Efficient Queries**: Firestore queries with proper indexes and limits
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Components only render when data is available
5. **Debouncing**: Search input could be debounced (future enhancement)
6. **Caching**: Report data could be cached (future enhancement)

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-based Access**: Admin screens should be protected by auth middleware
2. **Data Validation**: All user inputs should be validated
3. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Destructive operations require confirmation
4. **Session Checks**: Location deletion validates for active sessions
5. **Error Handling**: Sensitive error details not exposed to users

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term:
1. Add date range picker for custom reports
2. Implement debounced search
3. Add sorting options (by name, date, etc.)
4. Implement data caching
5. Add more chart types

### Long-term:
1. Advanced analytics with charts (Chart.js or Victory Native)
2. Email report scheduling
3. Push notifications for important events
4. Audit log for admin actions
5. Role-based permissions (super admin, admin, manager)
6. Multi-location management dashboard

---

## Integration Notes

### For Other Agents:
1. **Agent 2 (Auth)**: Ensure admin role is properly validated before accessing these screens
2. **Agent 4 (Payments)**: Payment transaction data is used in financial reports
3. **Agent 5 (Guard)**: Guard activity data can be integrated into reports
4. **Agent 8 (QR)**: Session data from QR scans flows into usage reports

### Navigation Setup Required:
Add these screens to the Admin navigation stack:
```typescript
<Stack.Screen name="UserManagement" component={UserManagementScreen} />
<Stack.Screen name="LocationManagement" component={LocationManagementScreen} />
<Stack.Screen name="Reports" component={ReportsScreen} />
```
