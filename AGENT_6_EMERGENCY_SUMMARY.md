└── EmergencyTracking (existing)
```

## Safety Features

1. **Permission Requests**: Proper handling of location permissions
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when GPS unavailable
3. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Before critical actions (delete, emergency call)
4. **Countdown Timer**: 5-second delay before panic button calls 911
5. **Cancel Options**: User can cancel panic countdown

## UI/UX Highlights

1. **Consistent Design**: Follows app theme and design system
2. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, empty states
3. **Color Coding**: Status-based colors for quick recognition
4. **Icon System**: Ionicons for all service types
5. **Responsive Cards**: Touch-friendly interface elements
6. **Gradient Headers**: Red gradient for emergency sections

## Honduras-Specific Features

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **SMS Integration**: Send location to emergency contacts via SMS

4. **Voice Recording**: Add voice notes to emergency requests
5. **Photo Upload**: Attach photos to emergency requests
6. **Hospital Locator**: Find nearest hospitals
7. **Insurance Integration**: Quick access to insurance information

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test GPS permissions on both iOS and Android
2. Verify 911 calling works on real devices
3. Test panic button countdown and cancel
4. Verify location accuracy in different areas
5. Test with/without internet connection
6. Validate emergency contact notifications

## Security Considerations

1. Location data is only captured during emergency events
2. Emergency contacts stored securely in Firebase
3. Call logs include timestamps for accountability
4. User consent required for location access
5. Data encryption for sensitive information
